# IMPLEMENTATION

# STEPS TO ADD date  COMMAND AS A SYSTEM CALL

1.	Command To be Added as the System Call : "date"  (should print the current date)

2. cd to xv6 on the terminal

3.  Defining the date function and its System Call Number in syscall.h

	Do 'gedit syscall.h' in the terminal. Add '#define SYS_date  22'. and SAVE
4.	Date Function declaration in the proc.c section of defs.h

	Do 'gedit defs.h'.Under the proc.c section of the file.
 Add 'int date(void);' and SAVE.

5.	Date Function declaration in the  user.h

	Do 'gedit user.h' in terminal. Add "int date(void)" Below the int uptime(void) function and SAVE

6.	Add date function implementation in the sysproc.c

	Do 'gedit sysproc.c'. Go down and write
		
			int 
			sys_date(void)
			{
			 struct rtcdate *r;    //creating a pointer *r of type struct rtcdate
			 if(argptr(0, (void*)&r, sizeof(r)) < 0)  
  //passing the pointer as an  argument to the qemu's  cmostime function which prints the    present day's date
			    return -1;
			 cmostime(r);	
			 return 0;
			}
 and SAVE
	
7.
		
  Do' gedit usys.S' and ADD SYSCALL(date) at the end and SAVE


8.	Adding function declaration in syscall.c file
	Do 'gedit syscall.c' and  Add  "extern int sys_date(void);" after the extern sys_uptime(void) and 
		go down to the SYS section of the same file and Add "[SYS_ps] sys_ps," at the end.

 

10.	Finally open the user-level program date.c  .This program is used to make system call
	
				#include "types.h"
				#include "user.h"
				#include "date.h"

				int
				main(int argc, char *argv[])
				{
				  struct rtcdate r;

				  if (date(&r)) {
				    printf(2, "date failed\n");
				    exit();
				  }

				   printf(1,"%d %d %d\n", r.day,r.month,r.year);  

				  exit();
				}

11.Do 'gedit Makefile' and Add "_ps\"  After the _wc\ section

12.Running it using qemu
	(MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE IN xv6 DIRECTORY)

	a)type make in the terminal.It will compile everything again

	b)type make qemu .It will open a new qemu terminal 

	c)type date and it will print the current date
